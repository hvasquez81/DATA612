DATA 612 Research Discussion Assignment 3
================

As more systems and sectors are driven by predictive analytics, there is increasing awareness of the possibility and pitfalls of algorithmic discrimination. In what ways do you think Recommender Systems reinforce human bias? Reflecting on the techniques we have covered, do you think recommender systems reinforce or help to prevent unethical targeting or customer segmentation? Please provide one or more examples to support your arguments.

Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil
-------------------------------------------

I recently read this book and from it I understood how algos can discriminate and target certain groups of people based off of their background, ethnicity, social status, and much more showing that recommender systems can reinforce unethical targeting and customer segmentation. The book goes over several examples over different industries and fields. An example that really stood out to me while reading the book was how the University of Phoenix is so profitable despite spending a billion dollars on marketing per year.

There are definitely a lot of other examples in the book in different areas like teaching, banking, employement, etc. I do recommend reading it just to understand how recommender systems and other machine learning systems in general show human bias, unethical targeting, and customer segmentation. In most cases they are built with these biases, and unethical targeting because they result in the most profitability for companies. It helps companies target which customers will provide the most revenue to them while spending the least amount of money advertising to customer that are not desperate to lose weight, or take out a loan for example.

##### University of Phoenix

The short gist of this scandle was that the University of Phoenix was marketing to people based off of their search history, and tying them to people who were looking to turn their life around. They targeted poor people looking to move up in careers. And of these poor people they were looking to target, they targeted those most likely to be elligle for government loans to pay for their overpriced tuition. After doing so, the victims were elligible to take out large loans for these for-profit universities that research eventually concluded were no better than attending a local community college. The recommender system saw people's vulnerabilities through their browsing history, location and other attributes and sold them the dream of furthering their education at a private university. ITT Tech and over univeristies were also mentioned using the same practices.
